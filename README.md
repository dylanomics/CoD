# CoD

## Overview
This project explores **Cost of Delay (CoD) and Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** as decision-making frameworks to prioritize tasks in a **financial setting**.

### Key Features:
- **Linear, Exponential, Deadline Based models**
- **WSJF prioritization applied to credit union loan processing**
- **Visualizations of decision-making impact**

## Results
- **Auto Loans should be processed first** because they generate high revenue in less time.
- **Mortgage Loans follow** since they generate a lot but take longer.
- **Personal Loans are last** due to their lower revenue impact.

## Why This Matters
Prioritization is crucial in **finance, product development, and project management**.  
WSJF helps teams **maximize value while minimizing delays**.
